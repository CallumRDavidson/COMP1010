\section{Introduction}
This is an introduction
\label{sec:intro}

\section{Predicitve model marketing camplaign}
This article presents a mofel for predicting trends in marketing campaign influence  in e-commerce, or as defined in the paper " The extent to which a marketing campaign is spread among the user groups on that e-commerce platform".

\section{Click through rate model based on user interest and temporal behaviour }


CLick through rate is the ratio of the number users who click on an ad to the number of users who viewed the ad https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate
paper designs a structure of time-weighted gated recurrent units (TW-GRU) to predict users’
short-term interest and long-term interest. 
The paper found that when anlayzing user behviour data that in shorter time intervals, the item's a user purchased were in related categories whereas in longer term patterns the users purchased items were found to be less relevant to eachother.
